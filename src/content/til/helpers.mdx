## [Heap out of memory fix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/increase-memory-limit)

```bash
increase-memory-limit
```

## Version number of package

```bash
grep version node_modules/react/package.json
```

## Check dependency conflicts

```bash
npm ls react-dom
```

## Update library to alpha version

```bash
npm version prerelease --preid=alpha.1
```

## Templates

When working from a js template, it's helpful to make a deep copy, so the original template is preserved. I have run into some issues with this many times, and it still bites me.

```ts
import clone from "just-clone";

const template = {
  "1a": {
    id: "1a",
    name: "template 1",
    widgets: [],
  },
};

function getTemplate(id: string) {
  return clone(template[id]);
}
```

## Debugging

### Trace deprecation

Replace `node_modules/gatsby/dist/bin/gatsby` with the runner of the script.

```bash
node --trace-deprecation node_modules/gatsby/dist/bin/gatsby build
```

This helped me find an issue I was running into with Gatsby 4.0 on `build`. The error I was seeing was:

```bash
[DEP_WEBPACK_COMPILATION_ASSETS] DeprecationWarning: Compilation.assets will be frozen in future, all modifications are deprecated.
BREAKING CHANGE: No more changes should happen to Compilation.assets after sealing the Compilation.
    Do changes to assets earlier, e. g. in Compilation.hooks.processAssets.
    Make sure to select an appropriate stage from Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_*.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
```

This case was caused by `gatsby-plugin-bundle-stats` and was fixed when commented out.

### Logging to Terminal

When using a standard console log, `console.log('stars', stars)`, to the terminal in a node.js app, you might see some of the values at a certain depth be represented by `[object]` or `[Array]`. Let's consider the following data:

```javascript
const baseItems = {
  CHIPS_BLUE: {
    id: "CHIPS_BLUE",
    type: "chips",
    label: "Blue Corn Tortilla Chips",
    variants: ["blue corn"],
    attributes: ["organic", "non-gmo", "vegan", "gluten-free"],
  },
};

const toppingItems = {
  CHEEZE_BLEND_SHREDS: {
    id: "CHEEZE_BLEND_SHREDS",
    type: "cheese",
    label: "Cheeze Blend Shreds",
    variants: ["cheddar", "jack"],
    attributes: ["organic", "non-gmo", "vegan"],
  },
  JALAPENOS: {
    id: "JALAPENOS",
    type: "vegetable",
    label: "Jalapenos",
    variants: ["sliced"],
    attributes: ["organic", "non-gmo", "vegan", "gluten-free"],
  },
};

const nachos = [
  {
    base: [baseItems["CHIPS_BLUE"]],
    toppings: [toppingItems["CHEEZE_BLEND_SHREDS"], toppingItems["JALAPENOS"]],
  },
];
```

With `console.log("nachos", nachos);`, we get:

```bash
nachos [ { base: [ [Object] ], toppings: [ [Object], [Object] ] } ]
```

To see the rest of the values we can use `console.dir()` with the first argument being the object to log and the second specifying the depth. In this case, we'll set the depth to `null` to show all levels.

So `console.dir({ nachos }, { depth: null });` gives us:

```javascript
{
  nachos: [
    {
      base: [
        {
          id: "CHIPS_BLUE",
          type: "chips",
          label: "Blue Corn Tortilla Chips",
          variants: ["blue corn"],
          attributes: ["organic", "non-gmo", "vegan", "gluten-free"],
        },
      ],
      toppings: [
        {
          id: "CHEEZE_BLEND_SHREDS",
          type: "cheese",
          label: "Cheeze Blend Shreds",
          variants: ["cheddar", "jack"],
          attributes: ["organic", "non-gmo", "vegan"],
        },
        {
          id: "JALAPENOS",
          type: "vegetable",
          label: "Jalapenos",
          variants: ["sliced"],
          attributes: ["organic", "non-gmo", "vegan", "gluten-free"],
        },
      ],
    },
  ];
}
```
