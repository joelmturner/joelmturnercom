After my year of lettering I continued going with my hand lettering and sketches on a daily basis. Much of my practice was inspired by other hand lettering and sketch artists that I found through Instagram. Looking back on 2016 I can see that I enjoy geometric shapes and ancient ideas/concepts. Here is a collection of my best from 2016.
