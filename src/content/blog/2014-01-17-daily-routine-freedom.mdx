The more I explore myself, the more I realize that my "freedom" is not from not having anything to do but by doing things that give me purpose.

## Watching the Clock with Nothing to Do

I spent many years without a daily routine. Not having a routine made me watch the clock, not getting anything done and I found it hard to feel fulfilled at the end of the day. Not having a routine made me check the time often and gave me a feeling like I was wasting time in some way. I wasn't sure how to get things done or which item I should start next. There were no priorities and therefore, no way to know what was important.

## Creating a Daily Routine

It seemed counter intuitive to me but setting a full daily routine has helped me feel more free. I think part of the freedom feeling is feeling fulfilled. Doing what is important to me helps me feel like I have taken care of my list, even if some office work doesn't get finished. Creating a daily routine for me is about simplicity. If I do the things that are most important for my welfare, I feel fulfilled. For me, if I do my daily meditation and mantra practice, I feel good, even if more work came in than I was able to finish. I have noticed that doing something daily, even if it is only for a few minutes a day, makes me much better at it. Aly Dunne ([@thewayofmantra](https://twitter.com/thewayofmantra)) explains how a [daily practice is like a river](http://thewayofmantra.com/daily-practice-the-unstoppable-power/) wearing down rock over time. Here is a quick view of my daily routine:

- Wake up, meditate, chant
- Drink elixir (modified from [Apple Cider Vinegar Elixir](https://kaleuniversity.org/recipes/apple-cider-vinegar-elixir/)), walk dogs, start hot water for tea, sing to [my kombucha scoby](https://plus.google.com/+JoelTurnerGo/posts/UNyep6bPPCy)
- Work on graphic/web projects
- Eat lunch
- Work on graphic/web projects
- Go for run, walk dogs, walk by myself
- Meet with friends, network
- Wind down, sleep
