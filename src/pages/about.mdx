## I am Joel M Turner

My professional role is **Senior Product Engineer** (Frontend) at [Sprinklr](https://sprinklr.com), where I help support the visualization products. Through this avenue, I have been able to contribute to some great projects such as the [World Health Organization Covid-19 Dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/), the [Covid HQ Africa Dashboard](https://tracker.covidhqafrica.com/), and [Sprinklr.com](https://sprinklr.com).

### How I Got Here

I was born in Laramie, Wyoming. I received my BA with a graphic design emphasis in December of 2005. Most of my free time in college was spent playing in the Symphony Orchestra and playing basketball. I dabble in hand lettering and illustration, which I share mainly on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joelmturner/) and have the "best of," in my opinion, on my [illustration page](/illustration).

I spent many of my summers living on glaciers in Alaska. Living in a remote camp with many other interesting people was great; you never know where the conversations will go and what kind of friends you'll make. While I was on the glacier, I would read PHP books and write code on a piece of paper which I would enter on my computer when I had a day off in town. Between this and cramming as much CSS as I could, I would cobble together some experience in building sites.

After a few years of performing design, design systems, and development roles for a superfood company, I was encouraged by my friend to apply for an internship with his team at Sprinklr. Since then, I have been coding away on TypeScript, React, MobX, and Gatsby projects.

### Now

I now live with my wife, [Suzanne Turner](http://inclinedcreative.com "Suzanne Turner InclinedCreative"), our two children, and our two dogs in Portland, Oregon.
