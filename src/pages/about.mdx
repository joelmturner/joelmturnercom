## I am Joel M Turner

My professional role is **Senior Product Engineer** (Frontend) at [Sprinklr](https://sprinklr.com), where I help support the visualization products. Through this avenue, I have been able to contribute to some great projects such as the [World Health Organization Covid-19 Dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/), the [Covid HQ Africa Dashboard](https://tracker.covidhqafrica.com/), and [Sprinklr.com](https://sprinklr.com).

### How I Got Here

I grew up in the beautiful city of Laramie, Wyoming. After graduating with a degree in graphic design in 2005, I spent my summers living on glaciers in Alaska. It was there that I started to teach myself how to code, writing PHP and CSS on paper and entering it into my computer during my days off in town.

Fast forward a few years and I'm now working as a developer for Sprinklr, where I get to use awesome technologies like TypeScript, React, MobX, and Gatsby to build amazing projects. In my free time, I love dabbling in hand lettering and illustration, and I share my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joelmturner/). I even have my own [illustration page](/illustration) where I showcase my "best of" creations.

Overall, I've had a really fun and interesting journey so far, and I can't wait to see where my love of coding takes me next!

### Now

I now live with my wife, [Suzanne Turner](https://inclinedcreative.com 'Suzanne Turner InclinedCreative'), our two children, and our two dogs in Portland, Oregon.

### Fun side projects

I love food and Portland doesn't disappoint! Portland Mercury puts on a few different food weeks were there are a number of options. I wanted a way to quickly filter those options so I started creating my own version of what I found helpful.

- [PDX Nacho Week - 2019](https://pdx-nacho-week.netlify.app) - using existing data from Portland Mercury to easily filter by dietary preference and location
- [PDX Sandwich Week - 2022](https://pdx-sandwich-week.netlify.app/) - using existing data from Portland Mercury to easily filter by dietary preference and location
