## I am Joel M Turner

My professional role is **Senior Product Engineer** at [Copilot CRM](https://copilotcrm.com), where I help build the new experience while contributing to some legacy code. Previously, I was a **Lead Product Engineer** (Frontend) at [Sprinklr](https://sprinklr.com), where I helped support the visualization products. Through this avenue, I have been able to contribute to some great projects such as the World Health Organization Covid-19 Dashboard, the Covid HQ Africa Dashboard, and [Sprinklr Display](https://www.sprinklr.com/products/platform/display/).

### How I Got Here

I grew up in the beautiful city of Laramie, Wyoming. After graduating with a degree in graphic design in 2005, I spent my summers living on glaciers in Alaska. It was there that I started to teach myself how to code, writing PHP and CSS on paper and entering it into my computer during my days off in town.

Fast forward a few years and I'm now working as a developer for Copilot CRM, where I get to use awesome technologies like TypeScript, React, ReactNative, TanStack Query, and NextJS to build amazing projects. In my free time, I love dabbling in hand lettering and illustration, and I share my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joelmturner/) and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/joelmturner.com). I even have my own [illustration page](/illustration) where I showcase my "best of" creations.

Overall, I've had a really fun and interesting journey so far, and I can't wait to see where my love of coding takes me next!

### Now

I now live with my wife, [Suzanne Turner](https://inclinedcreative.com "Suzanne Turner InclinedCreative"), our two children, and our two dogs in Portland, Oregon.
