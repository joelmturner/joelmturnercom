# Styling Guide

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, configured in [global.css](../../src/styles/global.css).

## Key Styling Principles

1. Use Tailwind's utility classes for consistent, maintainable styling
2. Custom theme tokens are defined in the `@theme` directive in [global.css](../../src/styles/global.css)
3. Global styles are managed in `src/styles/` using Tailwind's `@layer` directives
4. Component-specific styles should use utility classes or the `@layer components` directive when needed

## Configuration

- Theme configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive in [global.css](../../src/styles/global.css)
- Tailwind is integrated via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin in [astro.config.mjs](mdc:astro.config.mjs)
- Custom CSS variables and properties are defined in the `@theme` block
- Dark mode is handled using `data-color-mode` attribute with custom variants

## Best Practices

1. Prefer utility classes over custom CSS - use Tailwind's built-in utilities first
2. Define custom design tokens in the `@theme` directive using CSS custom properties
3. Use `@layer base` for global resets and base element styles
4. Use `@layer components` for reusable component patterns that can't be achieved with utilities alone
5. Use `@layer utilities` for custom utility classes when needed
6. Leverage Tailwind's responsive and state variants (hover, focus, dark, etc.)
7. Use semantic class names with utilities (e.g., `text-primary`, `bg-accent`) that reference theme tokens
8. Keep component styles co-located with components when using `@layer components`
