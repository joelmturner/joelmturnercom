# Source Code Organization

Use this map when deciding where new files should live in `src/`:

- `pages/` Astro routes and page-level entry points
- `layouts/` reusable page wrappers and templates
- `components/` reusable UI components
- `lib/` shared utilities and cross-component logic
- `icons/` SVG assets and icon components
- `styles/` global styles, layers, and shared CSS utilities
- `content/` content collections and content schema definitions
- [consts.ts](mdc:src/consts.ts) global constants
- [env.d.ts](mdc:src/env.d.ts) environment and type declarations

## Development Guidelines

1. Add new routes in `pages/` and rely on Astro file-based routing conventions.
2. Place reusable UI elements in `components/`; keep page-specific markup in `pages/`.
3. Put reusable non-UI logic in `lib/` instead of inside page/component files.
4. Keep content schemas and collection definitions in `content/`.
5. Co-locate files by feature where practical, while preserving this top-level structure.
