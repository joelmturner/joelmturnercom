# Source Code Organization

The `src/` directory contains the following structure:
- `pages/` - Astro pages and routes
- `layouts/` - Layout components and templates
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `lib/` - Utility functions and shared logic
- `icons/` - SVG icons and icon components
- `styles/` - Global styles and style utilities
- `content/` - Content collections and data
- [consts.ts](mdc:src/consts.ts) - Global constants
- [env.d.ts](mdc:src/env.d.ts) - TypeScript environment declarations

## Development Guidelines
1. New pages should be added to the `pages/` directory following Astro's file-based routing
2. Reusable components should be placed in `components/` with appropriate subdirectories for organization
3. Shared utilities should go in `lib/`
4. Content types and collections should be defined in `content/`
