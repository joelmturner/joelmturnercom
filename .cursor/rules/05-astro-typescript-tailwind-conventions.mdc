# Astro TypeScript Tailwind Conventions

Use these conventions when implementing or updating frontend code in this repository.

## Astro and Component Design

1. Keep Astro components modular, reusable, and focused on a single responsibility.
2. Favor composition through `layouts/` and `components/` over large monolithic pages.
3. Preserve clear separation of concerns between markup, behavior, and shared utilities in `src/lib/`.

## TypeScript Standards

1. Follow strict TypeScript settings from [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json) and avoid `any` unless justified.
2. Prefer explicit, narrow types for props, function arguments, and return values.
3. Keep shared types close to their domain and promote reusable types when patterns repeat.

## Tailwind and Styling

1. Prefer Tailwind utility classes first for component styling.
2. Use shared design tokens and theme variables defined in [global.css](mdc:src/styles/global.css).
3. Add custom CSS in `src/styles/` only when utilities are insufficient, using `@layer` conventions.

## Code Quality and Comments

1. Keep code changes readable, testable, and consistent with existing lint and format rules.
2. Comments should explain intent (why), not mechanics (what).
3. When adding comments, start them with a lower-case letter.
