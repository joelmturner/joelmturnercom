import Avatar, {SeriesBlock} from './components';

<SeriesBlock />

In this series we're going to take a look at creating a simple avatar component that is typed with TypeScript and has some special goodies in Gatsby land.

> I usually write TypeScript from the start but I wanted to show each piece individually in case others aren't familiar with TypeScript yet. 

Let's start by identifying what our needs are for our avatar component. 

- Should show an image
- Should be round
- Should accept an image url
- Should display an image based on name (for small sets)

Cool, now we can start building our avatar. Start with an img element using a placeholder image as src. Add a little bit of styling to make it round and give it a size. 

```jsx
function Avatar(props){

    const {url, altText, title} = props;

    const styles = {
        width: '75px',
        height: '75px',
        borderRadius: '50%'
    }

    return (
        <img
            style={styles}
            src={url}
            alt={altText}
            title={title} />
    );
}

export default Avatar;
```

Then we can pass it the image url and alt text. We can see that the component is working in its basic implementation now.


<Grid columns='75px 3fr' gap={2} sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
<Flexbox middle>
    <Avatar /> 
</Flexbox>

```jsx
<Avatar
    url="https://res.cloudinary.com/joelmturner/monster-01.png"
    alText='Monster P. Whittington portrait'
    title='Monster P. Whittington' />
```
</Grid>

Looks good. We've met our first three criteria for this component. In step 2 we'll make it more powerful with Gatsby Image.
