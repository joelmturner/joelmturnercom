For the past month and a half, I have played with hand lettering to help me practice more hands-on design. I have chosen to spend about half an hour each day on each (longer on weekends) and not to edit them digitally.

Each day, I post a new lettering sketch on <a href="https://instagram.com/joelmturner/">Instagram</a> and log the medium used on <a href="https://plus.google.com/collection/oWKCX">Google+</a>.

Here are&nbsp;the creations so far:
