After seeing Scott Bradlee and Post Modern Jukebox live in Portland on their Eviction Tour, I was inspired to create some promo images.

## Post Modern Jukebox Artwork

This first graphic is based on the design of the Post Modern Jukebox website. [![Post Modern Jukebox Promotional Poster](https://res.cloudinary.com/joelmturner/blog/2014/12/PMJ-Promotional-Poster.jpg)](https://res.cloudinary.com/joelmturner/blog/2014/12/PMJ-Promotional-Poster.jpg)

## Scott Bradlee Art

This one is for the Scott Bradlee whoÂ put the group together, writes the arrangements, and plays the piano. The poster is based on the jazz style event posters.

## Robyn Adele Anderson Art

The next one is a promotion of one of the main singers, Robyn Adele-Anderson.
