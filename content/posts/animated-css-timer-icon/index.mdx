I recently had a need for a timer/revert icon that can animate forward and backward.

## Pure CSS

I wanted it to be a purely CSS and HTML versus an animated SVG or GIF so it can be manipulated more easily in the browser.

## Adjustable Size

The size of the icon is relative to the wrapper so setting a different font-size will scale the icon proportionally.

## Animation in Multiple Directions

The icon needs to animate forward and backward as well as have a rest state. The animation uses CSS keyframes based on the classes, 'forward' and 'backward'.
