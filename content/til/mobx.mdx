# MobX

## Debugging

### trace()
`trace()` helps show what it was that made MobX update. this is helpful for tracking down unexpected renders or infinite loops.

```jsx
import {trace} from 'mobx-react'

{...}
render() {
  trace();
  return ();
}
```
## toJS()
Each observable has a method of `toJS()` on it. May need to look into typing them correctly.
