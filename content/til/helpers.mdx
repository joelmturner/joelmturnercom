## Update library to alpha version

## Templates
When working from a js template, it's helpful to make a deep copy, so the original template is preserved. I have run into some issues with this many times, and it still bites me.
```ts
import cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep'

const template = {
	'1a': {
		id: '1a',
		name: 'template 1',
		widgets: []
	}
}

function getTemplate(id: string) {
	return cloneDeep(template[id])
}
```
