## From Unfu*k Yourself — Gary John Bishop

### Unwillingness

Unwillingness can be as powerful a motivator as willingness. For example, one person might be motivated by saying, "I am willing to go for a run right now," while another person might be motivated by saying, "I can't sit on this couch another minute!" We can find which works for us in certain situations.

Try making statements of willingness or unwillingness with conviction for a couple of weeks to see how things shift in behaviors and patterns.

### Wired to Win

We are wired to win no matter what. Even if we consciously think we're losing — not making money, no love life, etc. — we are just being the best at the game we can be. Subconsciously we may be thinking our parents did such a lousy job raising us and I'm going to show just how poorly they did by spending frivolously, breaking hearts, getting into relationships with people who I know will hurt me, etc.

If we're going to win anyway we might as well practice winning in conscious direction instead of the old patterns.
